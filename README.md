# KernMLOps

This repository serves as the mono-repo for the KernMLOps research project.

Currently, it only contains scripts for data collection of kernel performance.

Quick Setup:

```shell
make dependencies
make hooks
make docker-image
# Ensure you have installed your kernel's development headers
# On ubuntu: apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
# On redhat: dnf install kernel-devel kernel-headers
make collect
```

## Tools

### [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com)

Provides a declarative set of tools pinned to
specific versions for environmental consistency.

These tools are defined in `.tool-versions`.
Run `make dependencies` to initialize a new environment.

### [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com)

A left shifting tool to consistently run a set of checks on the code repo.
Our checks enforce syntax validations and formatting.
We encourage contributors to use pre-commit hooks.

```shell
# install all pre-commit hooks
make hooks

# run pre-commit on repo once
make pre-commit
```

### [bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)

A toolset for building eBPF programs including python bindings.

It is highly recommended to build this from scratch so that its python package
can be pip installed to your local environment.  By default system packages will
only install it for the system python, which may complicate development for user
level package management.

Building instructions are provided [here](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md#source)
for most major distributions.

After installing, the python package can be installed to your local environment via:

```shell
pip install -e BCC_BUILD_DIR/src/python/bcc-python3
```

Verify proper installation with:

```python
import bcc
```

## Dependencies

### Python

Python is required, version `3.12` is recommended for best compatibility.

Python package dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be
installed via `pip`.

They can also be install via [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/).
If `conda` is used then it is recommended to then install `mamba` and use
that as a drop in replacement.
This can be done with `conda install -conda-forge mamba`.

Or by [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

Then the python packages can be installed via:

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt
mamba install -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt
```

### Creating VMs

For ubuntu the requirements can be installed with:

```shell
sudo apt install -y bc flex bison gcc make libelf-dev libssl-dev \
    squashfs-tools busybox-static tree cpio curl
```

## Contributing

Developers should verify their code passes basic standards by running:

```shell
make lint
```

Developers can automatically fix many common styling issues with:

```shell
make format
```

## Usage

Users can run data collection with:

```shell
make collect-data
```
